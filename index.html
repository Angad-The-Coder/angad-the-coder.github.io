      <p>I am currently a freshman at Amador Valley High School with years-long passions for programming and graphic design. Web development and frontend design is a perfect collaboration of both these interests and I find it incredibly fulfilling.
        <br><br>
        As a programmer, I am equipped with skills in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cplusplus.com">C++</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>/<a target="_blank" href="https://www.javascript.com">JavaScript</a>—the languages I used to build this website. In addition, as a relative newcomer to web development, I am eager to learn new frameworks and languages to enhance my ability to craft elegant websites.
        <br><br>
        As a graphic designer, I am capable of photo editing in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getpaint.net">Paint.net</a>. I’ve been using these skills regularly since elementary school, whether that be to strengthen one of my school projects or to design my middle school’s eighth-grade graduation T-shirt <small>(shown below)</small>.

      <h2>My WebDev Journey</h2>
      <p>During winter break of 2020, a couple of my friends and I were participating in a program called <a target="_blank" href="https://tsaweb.org">Technology Student Association (TSA)</a>. In TSA, there are many different events one may compete in, all targeting skills in various aspects of technology. As someone with a fascination for all things software, I had signed up with my friends for all of the software-related events. One of these events in particular was Webmaster. The goal of Webmaster is to create two websites: one advertising your school’s TSA charter, and the other—called your design brief—serving as response to a specific prompt. This year’s prompt for the design brief was to create a website about a fictional medical telecommunications company. Originally, as I had no experience in web development, my job was to help with all the graphic design needed to make our website attractive. However, since we had assigned all of the programming work to a single person, we needed someone else to help out and code our design brief website. As I had been interested in web development for a long time, I figured I might as well give it a shot and, over the span of winter break, I learned how to code in HTML/CSS/JS and completed <a target="_blank" href="https://sai95752.github.io/medcomm.html">my team’s design brief</a>. As a result of my hard work, my team passed the regional competition and is set to participate in the statewide competition later this year. Ever since I made that website, I’ve been looking for new opportunities to explore the world of web development and refine my skills.

      <h2 class="gradient_text">My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the oboe, fencing, graphic design, and programming. I’ve been playing the oboe since sixth grade and, last year, I was first chair in my middle school’s wind ensemble.</p>
      <div class="img_div">
        <img class="no_crop" id="oboe_photo" src="images/oboe_photo.png" style="width: min(300px, 100%);">
        <p class="img_caption">Photo of me playing the oboe at a concert in seventh grade.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In addition, I have been an avid fencer since the summer of fifth grade and I’ve competed in various regional and national competitions across the country.</p>
      <div class="img_div">
        <img class="no_crop" id="fencing_photo" src="images/fencing_photo.png" style="width: min(800px, 100%);">
        <p class="img_caption">Photo of me fencing at the 2019 Fencing Summer Nationals competition</p>
      </div>
      <p>Next, as stated in my background, I have a strong passion for graphic design and I’ve pursued it since the second grade. Very often, I’ll find myself doing random graphic design projects just because I find it extremely calming. Lastly, the activity I’ve spent most of my time on this year is programming. Although I have been familiar with basic Python since fifth grade, I’ve only started to code religiously this year, ever since quarantine began. One of the reasons for this is that I'm a member of <a href="https://avbotz.com" target="_blank">AVBotz</a>, <a href="https://avbotz.com" target="_blank">ACE Coding</a>, <a href="https://avbotz.com" target="_blank">AmadorUAVs</a>, and <a href="https://avbotz.com" target="_blank">TSA</a>, all of which are coding-related clubs at my school. I’ve always had a strong affinity for math and logic, and coding is where I feel I’m able to let these interests shine.
